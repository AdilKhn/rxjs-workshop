# Drinking the RxJS KoolAid

### What is RxJS?

### So what's the big deal with Observables?
While Observables may just sound like the newest evolution of callbacks -> promises -> ..., there is a lot more to Observables.

### How is this workshop set-up?
This workshop is set-up as a mix of three different activities.
1. Examples to show the capabilities and wide variety of applications of Observables
2. Playground to explore Observables and methods
3. Exercises to use our new knowledge of Observables to solve some problems
