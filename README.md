# RxJS: Getting Uncomfortable with Reactive Extensions

From Rx what? To this Observables thing is pretty cool. To how did I live before Reactive Extensions!?!

### What is RxJS?
Reactive programming is programming with asynchronous data streams. This isn't anything new. Click events are really an asynchronous event stream, that you can observe and do some side effects. Reactive is that idea on steroids. You are able to create data streams of anything, not just from click and hover events. Streams are cheap and ubiquitous, anything can be a stream: variables, user inputs, properties, caches, data structures, etc. On top of that, we have a toolbox of functions to combine, create and filter any of those streams.

### So what's the big deal with Observables?
While Observables may just sound like the newest evolution of callbacks -> promises -> ..., there is a lot more to Observables.

### What are we going to cover?
 - 1. Let's talk about streams and observables
 - 2. Basic array example
 - 3. Difference between hot and cold observables
 - 4. Subjects example
 - 5. Autocomplete example
 - 6. Example from Rx Intro
 - 7. Integrating RxJS with existing callback and promise based code (stretch)
