# APIs example

"Who to follow" suggestions box with github api (https://api.github.com/users)

### Requirements:
We are going to focus on imitating its core features, which are:
<ul>
<li>On startup, load accounts data from the API and display 3 suggestions</li>
<li>On clicking "Refresh", load 3 other account suggestions into the 3 rows</li>
<li>On click 'x' button on an account row, clear only that current account and display another</li>
<li>Each row displays the account's avatar and links to their page</li>
<ul>
